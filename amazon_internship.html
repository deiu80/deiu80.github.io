						<h3>What have i learned?</h3>
						<h5>Technical skills</h5>
						<p>I gained experience in agile software development methodologies, which helped me to
							understand how to manage and own projects effectively
							and deliver high-quality software in a fast-paced environment.</p>

						<p>Acquired a good understanding of serverless architecture, including distributed systems
							and the principles of <strong>RESTful API</strong> design.</p>
						<p>Utilized a wide range of <strong> AWS services</strong> such as API Gateway, DynamoDB,
							Lambda, IAM,
							CloudWatch,
							CloudFormation </p>
						<p> I also have learned about <b> software testing and quality assurance</b>,
							which are critical components of building robust and scalable software.
							I have conducted <b> automated testing </b> using TestNG framework, ensuring high-quality
							software
							delivery.</p>
						<p>Deliverying my project required <b> Java</b> for building APIs and all serverless functionality in
							AWS while <b>Angular and TypeScript</b> were used for web development.</p>
						<h5>Career Development</h5>
						<p>Due to a highly collaborative work environment, and through working on a real-world
							project with my peers,
							I learned how to effectively communicate and share ideas with others.</p>
						<p>The internship provided me with valuable insights into the tech industry and the culture at
							Amazon.
							I had the opportunity to work alongside some of the best software engineers and gain
							exposure to real-world challenges.
							Additionally, Amazon's strong focus on mentorship and career development helped me to build
							my professional network
							and get guidance on how to navigate the tech industry as a young professional.</p>

						<h3>My manager's thoughts</h3>
						<blockquote>"I worked with Andrei for 3 months, during his Amazon internship. Andrei started
							slow in a competitive team which insists on the highest standards, is not so good on
							developing others, and avoids technical tradeoffs by any means. Andrei listened, asked
							clarifying questions, learned about the product, why is important, who are the customers,
							and how his project will contribute. With these details clarified, Andrei owned his project
							during the discussions within the team, during refinements, and incrementally delivered a
							functional solution after 3 months.
							<br><br>Technically, Andrei did a huge progress guided by his mentor and by individual
							learning. You proved you have the Amazon culture in your blood and you did contributed to
							our team mission. Thanks a lot and never give up to your ambition and ownership.

							I do recommend Andrei as a person who will make things happen, fast learner, and ability to
							adapt fast to any working environment.
							Kudos and may you make the right decisions in life :) "
							<br><br>
