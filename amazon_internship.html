                        <h3>My manager's thoughts</h3>
                        <blockquote>"I worked with Andrei for 3 months, during his Amazon internship. Andrei started slow in a competitive team which insists on the highest standards, is not so good on developing others, and avoids technical tradeoffs by any means. Andrei listened, asked clarifying questions, learned about the product, why is important, who are the customers, and how his project will contribute. With these details clarified, Andrei owned his project during the discussions within the team, during refinements, and incrementally delivered a functional solution after 3 months. 
                            <br><br>Technically, Andrei did a huge progress guided by his mentor and by individual learning. You proved you have the Amazon culture in your blood and you did contributed to our team mission. Thanks a lot and never give up to your ambition and ownership.

                            I do recommend Andrei as a person who will make things happen, fast learner, and ability to adapt fast to any working environment.
                             Kudos and may you make the right decisions in life :) "
                             <br><br>
